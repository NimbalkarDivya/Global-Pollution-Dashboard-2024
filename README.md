# Global Pollution Dashboard 2024 🌍

## 📌 Project Description
The **Global Pollution Dashboard 2024** is a data visualization project that analyzes **global air pollution and environmental risk** across countries and continents.  
Instead of only showing pollution levels, the dashboard converts **PM2.5 values into AQI**, making environmental and health impacts easier to understand.

The project highlights pollution severity, air quality categories, development status, and environmental infrastructure indicators such as sanitation, drinking water, and waste management.

## 📊 Dashboard Insights
- **Average AQI (PM2.5)** across countries
- **Pollution category** (Clean / Good / Moderate)
- **Country-wise pollution score & rank**
- **Continent-wise pollution severity**
- **Environmental Risk Score** by development status
- **EPI indicators**:
  - Sanitation
  - Drinking Water
  - Waste Management (2024)

---

## 🌍 Key Observations
- Some countries show **acceptable AQI** but still have **high environmental risk** due to poor sanitation and waste management.
- Developing and emerging nations face **higher pollution severity** compared to developed regions.
- Environmental infrastructure plays a major role in long-term pollution impact.
